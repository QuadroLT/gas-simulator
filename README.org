* Aim

Small application to learn basics thermodynamics. The  goal is to  write visualizer of molecule movement based on the energy provided to the system.


* Current thermodynamics implementations
- [X] molecules spawned
- [X] walls spawned
- [X] molecule-wall collision
- [X] molecule-to-molecule collition
- [ ] Thermal energy to kinetic energy relationship 
- [ ] energy transfer from wall to molecule
- [ ] energy transfer between molecules
- [ ] reaction between molecules (combustion)

* Current controls implementations

- [ ] UI for energetic initial state controls
- [ ] system's energy state visualizer
- [ ] implement bevy-rapier for phisics

* Running application
#+begin_src shell
  cargo build --release
  ./gas-simulator
#+end_src


* Some assumptions
** Thermal to kinetic energy relationship
$$ E_{k} = \frac{mv^{2}}{2} = \frac{2}{3} k T $$
