* Aim

Small application to learn basics thermodynamics. The  goal is to  write visualizer of molecule movement based on the energy provided to the system.


* Current thermodynamics implementations
- [X] molecules spawned
- [X] walls spawned
- [X] molecule-wall collision
- [ ] molecule-to-molecule collition
- [ ] Theral energy to kinetic energy relationship 
- [ ] energy transfer from wall to molecule
- [ ] energy transfer between molecules
- [ ] reaction between molecules (combustion)

* Current controls implementations

- [ ] UI for energetic initial state controls
- [ ] system's energy state visualizer
