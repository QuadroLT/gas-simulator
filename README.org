* Aim

Small application to learn basics thermodynamics. The  goal is to  write visualizer of molecule movement based on the energy provided to the system.


* Current thermodynamics implementations
- [X] molecules spawned
- [X] walls spawned
- [X] molecule-wall collision
- [X] molecule-to-molecule collition
- [ ] simulation states inserted
- [ ] Thermal energy to kinetic energy relationship 
- [X] energy transfer from wall to molecule
- [X] energy transfer between molecules
- [ ] reaction between molecules (combustion)

* Current controls implementations

- [ ] UI for energetic initial state controls
- [X] system's energy state visualizer
- [ ] implement bevy-rapier for phisics

* Running application
#+begin_src shell
  cargo build --release

* Some assumptions
** Thermal to kinetic energy relationship
Average kinetic energy ideal gas follows this equation:
$$ E_{k} = \frac{mv^{2}}{2} = \frac{2}{3} k T $$

$$ v = \sqrt{\frac{4kT}{3m}}
consequently  velocity is following function of mass and temperature: 
$$ v = \sqrt{\frac{4}{3} \frac{kT}{m} } $$

** Transfer of temperature form wall to molecule
$$ T'_{molecule} = \frac{T_{molecule} + T_{wall}}{2} $$
